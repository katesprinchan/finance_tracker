    "history1": "The Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (PMR) was proclaimed on September 2, 1990 as a result of the will of its inhabitants. The referendums were the result of a series of strikes by workers of Pridnestrovian enterprises against the discriminatory law “On Languages” adopted by the Parliament of Moldova in 1989, which violated the rights of nationalities. Statehood has become a form of protecting the interests of the peoples of Pridnestrovie.",
    "history2": "The proclamation of the republic was also logical from a political point of view: in June 1990, the Moldovan parliament declared the creation of the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic (MSSR) illegal, and thus Chisinau withdrew from its membership. In fact, he abandoned a common state with Pridnestrovie - the MSSR was formed in 1940 by uniting (by directive of the Soviet government) Bessarabia and the regions on the left bank of the Dniester, which at that time were part of the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (MASSR) with its capital in Tiraspol.",
    "important": "An important point: historically, Bessarabia and Pridnestrovie were part of different political or regional associations. Only in a short 50-year period, from August 1940 to September 1990, were the two regions formally and legally united into a union Soviet republic. \nResidents of Pridnestrovie did not accept the idea of ​​a titular nation, which Chisinau tried to impose. Multilingualism, cultural diversity, and international thinking have historically been the hallmarks of Pridnestrovie. Numerous archaeological finds indicate that the territory of the republic has been a point of intersection and coexistence of various cultural traditions since ancient times. Scientists state: Pridnestrovie is one of three unique historical and cultural regions of Eastern Europe (along with the Caucasus and Crimea), where at all times there has been a mixing of peoples, which led to the emergence of vibrant cultural traditions.",
